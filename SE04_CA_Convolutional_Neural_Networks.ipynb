    "## 4.2 Recreating CNN architectures\n",
    "***\n",
    "There are many different CNN architectures that have been proposed in the literature, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most popular architectures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Architecture | Description | Key Features |\n",
    "|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **LeNet** | One of the first CNN architectures, designed for handwritten digit recognition | 5 layers, small kernel sizes |\n",
    "| **AlexNet** | A deeper architecture that won the ImageNet competition in 2012 | 8 layers, ReLU activation, dropout, data augmentation |\n",
    "| **VGG** | A very deep architecture with small kernel sizes | 16-19 layers, uniform architecture, small kernels |\n",
    "| **ResNet** | Introduced residual connections to allow for very deep networks | 50-152 layers, skip connections, batch normalization |\n",
    "| **Inception** | Introduced the inception module for multi-scale feature extraction | 22-164 layers, parallel convolutions, pooling layers |\n",
    "| **DenseNet** | Introduced dense connections between layers | 121-201 layers, dense connections, feature reuse |\n",
    "\n",
    "These architectures have been shown to perform well on a variety of tasks, and they can be used as a starting point for building custom CNNs. Furthermore, many of these architectures are often visualised as a series of blocks, where each block consists of a convolutional layer followed by an activation function and a pooling layer. We are going to implement a version of the original VGG architecture, which looks like this:\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 Pooling\n",
    "***\n",
    "> <img src=\"figs/icons/write.svg\" width=\"20\"/> **Definition**: Pooling is a downsampling operation used in CNNs to reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps while retaining important information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling helps to reduce the number of parameters and computations in the network, making it more efficient and less prone to overfitting. There are several types of pooling operations, but the most common ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Pooling Type | PyTorch Function | Description |\n",
    "|--------------|------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Max Pooling** | `torch.nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size, stride)` | Takes the maximum value in each region defined by the kernel size |\n",
    "| **Average Pooling** | `torch.nn.AvgPool2d(kernel_size, stride)` | Takes the average value in each region defined by the kernel size |\n",
    "| **Global Average Pooling** | `torch.nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size)` | Reduces each feature map to a single value by averaging over the entire map |\n",
    "| **Global Max Pooling** | `torch.nn.AdaptiveMaxPool2d(output_size)` | Reduces each feature map to a single value by taking the maximum over the entire map |\n",
    "\n",
    "The pooling operation can be visualised like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure style=\"background-color: white; border-radius: 10px; padding: 20px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"figs/pooling.png\" alt=\"Pooling Operation\" align=\"center\" style=\"width: 40%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;\">\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, we use max pooling, as it helps to retain the most important features while discarding less relevant information. The pooling operation is typically applied after a convolutional layer and an activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 Regularisation\n",
    "***\n",
    "As briefly mentioned in the previous session, regularisation is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and outliers, leading to poor generalisation on unseen data. In CNNs, regularisation techniques are crucial due to the large number of parameters and the complexity of the models. Some common regularisation techniques used in CNNs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Regularisation Technique | Pytorch Function | Description |\n",
    "|--------------------------|------------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Dropout** | `torch.nn.Dropout(p)` | Randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting |\n",
    "| **L2 Regularisation** | `torch.nn.functional.mse_loss()` | Adds a penalty on the size of the weights to the loss function. This is also known as weight decay |\n",
    "| **Batch Normalisation** | `torch.nn.BatchNorm2d(num_features)` | Normalises the output of a previous activation layer by subtracting the batch mean and dividing by the batch standard deviation. This helps to stabilise the learning process and can lead to faster convergence |\n",
    "| **Data Augmentation** | `torchvision.transforms` | Increases the diversity of the training set by applying random transformations to the input data, such as rotation, translation, and scaling. This helps to improve the generalisation of the model |\n",
    "| **Early Stopping** | `torch.nn.utils` | Stops training when the validation loss stops improving, preventing overfitting |\n",
    "| **Weight Decay** | `torch.optim.AdamW` | Adds a penalty on the size of the weights to the loss function, similar to L2 regularisation. This is also known as weight decay |\n",
    "\n",
    "For our tiny VGG architecture, we are going to use dropout and batch normalisation. The dropout layer is applied after the activation function of the fully connected layers, while the batch normalisation layer is applied after the convolutional layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tiny VGG architecture will look like this:\n",
    "<figure style=\"background-color: white; border-radius: 10px; padding: 20px; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\">\n",
