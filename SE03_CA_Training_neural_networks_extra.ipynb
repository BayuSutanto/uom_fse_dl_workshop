Standard normalization in PINNs is tricky because physical equations must remain consistent with the scaled variables. The normalization should be applied to the loss function considering the physics of the problem. This is a more complex process and requires a deeper understanding of the physical equations involved. In this workshop, we will not cover this topic in detail, but it is important to keep in mind that normalisation in PINNs is not as straightforward as in traditional machine learning."

    "The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function.

    "When training a PINN model, the choice of optimiser is crucial for achieving good performance. While the Adam optimiser is a popular choice for many deep learning tasks, it may not always be the best choice for PINNs. A better choice for PINNs is the L-BFGS (Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) optimiser, which is a quasi-Newton method that approximates the inverse Hessian matrix. L-BFGS is particularly well-suited for PINNs because it can efficiently handle the large number of parameters in the model and can converge faster than Adam in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in order to use L-BFGS, we need to ensure that the loss function is differentiable with respect to the model parameters. This is important because L-BFGS uses second-order information (the Hessian) to update the model parameters. If the loss function is not differentiable, L-BFGS may not converge or may converge to a suboptimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use the L-BFGS optimiser in PyTorch, we need to define a closure function that computes the loss and gradients. The closure function is called by the L-BFGS optimiser to compute the loss and gradients at each iteration. The closure function should return the loss value and the gradients of the model parameters with respect to the loss.\n",

This can lead to different model performance depending on the distribution of the data.\n",

Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

    "As we can see in the following figure, the training loss decreases over time, while the validation loss follows a similar trend. However, the validation loss starts to slowly deviate from the training loss after a certain number of epochs. This indicates that the model is starting to overfit the training data. The point at which the validation loss starts to increase is known as the \"early stopping\" point. This is the point at which we should stop training the model to prevent overfitting.\n",

    "Since we are training a model with MSE loss, we can also plot the predicted output against the actual output to see how well the model is performing. The predicted output should be close to the actual output, and the points should be clustered around the diagonal line. If the points are scattered far from the diagonal line, it indicates that the model is not performing well.\n",

    "We can also compute the R-squared value to quantify the performance of the model. The R-squared value is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variance in the data, and 1 indicates that the model explains all of the variance in the data.\n",
