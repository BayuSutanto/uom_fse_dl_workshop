   - Download the notebook to your local machine.
   - Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - Click on "File > Upload Notebook" and select the downloaded notebook.

### Setting Up the GPU Environment on Colab

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Navigate to "Runtime > Change runtime type".
3. In the "Hardware accelerator" dropdown, select "GPU".
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

### Getting familiar with Google Colab

- [Google Colab Tips and Tricks](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) - Overview of basic features in Google Colab
- [Google Colab FAQ](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html) - Frequently asked questions about Google Colab

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Google Colab has a maximum session time limit of 12 hours. If your session times out, you may need to re-run the notebook from the beginning. Save your work frequently to avoid data loss.

### Installing Required Libraries in Colab

At the beginning of each notebook, ensure you run the firtst code cell to install the required libraries.

For GPU support, PyTorch will automatically utilize the GPU if available.

### Using the Exercise Checker üìù

Each workshop notebook contains exercises marked with üéØ. The exercise checker helps you verify your solutions and provides hints when needed.

#### Checking Your Solutions
```python
# At the end of each exercise, there will be a check block:
answer = {
    'your_solution': your_tensor,
    'another_part': another_result
}
checker.check_exercise(exercise_number, answer)
```

#### Getting Hints
If you're stuck, you can get hints for any exercise:
```python
# Display hints for exercise 1
checker.display_hints(1)
```

#### Exercise Feedback
The checker provides immediate feedback:
- ‚úÖ Correct solutions are marked with a green checkmark
- ‚ùå Incorrect solutions show what went wrong
- üí° Helpful hints appear when needed

### Common Workflows

1. **Starting an Exercise**:
   - Read the exercise description carefully
   - Implement your solution in the provided code cell
   - Run the cell to see if it works

2. **Checking Your Work**:
   - The checker automatically validates your solution
   - Multiple aspects may be checked (values, shapes, types)
   - All parts must be correct to pass

3. **Getting Help**:
   - Use `checker.display_hints()` for guidance
   - Hints are context-aware and specific to each exercise
   - Multiple hints may be available per exercise

4. **Learning from Mistakes**:
   - Pay attention to error messages
   - Check tensor shapes and types when debugging
   - Use print statements to understand intermediate results
