## Workshop Overview üìã

This hands-on workshop will guide participants through the fundamentals of deep learning with PyTorch, covering:

- PyTorch's tensor operations and automatic differentiation
- Building and training neural networks for various tasks
- Implementing CNNs for computer vision and time series forecasting
- Applying transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Working with RNNs for sequential data
- Developing multi-class classification models

## Setting Up Your Development Environment üõ†Ô∏è

### Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code

We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this workshop as it provides excellent Python and Jupyter Notebook support.

#### Installing VS Code
1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Install the following extensions for a better experience:
   - Python
   - Jupyter
   - Pylance
   - Python Indent
   - IntelliCode

To install extensions in VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for each extension, and click "Install".

### Why Use a Virtual Environment? üîí

Using a virtual environment is essential for Python development because it:

- Isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts between projects
- Makes your project reproducible across different machines
- Allows easy management of package versions
- Keeps your global Python installation clean

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment üì¶

#### Windows

```powershell
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv dl_workshop_env

# Activate the environment
dl_workshop_env\Scripts\activate

# Deactivate the environment when finished
deactivate
```

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv dl_workshop_env

# Activate the environment
source dl_workshop_env/bin/activate

# Deactivate the environment when finished
deactivate
```

### Required Libraries üìö

Install the necessary packages after activating your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter urllib3 requests tqdm 
```

For GPU support (NVIDIA GPUs only):

```bash
# Install the latest version of PyTorch with CUDA support

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Note: Replace 'cu118' with the appropriate CUDA version for your system.
```

No GPU? No problem! PyTorch will automatically fall back to CPU. Install the CPU version of PyTorch using the command below:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
