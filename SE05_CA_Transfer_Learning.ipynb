    "***\n",
    "> <img src=\"figs/icons/write.svg\" width=\"20\"/> **Definition**: Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as a starting point for a model on a second task. It's particularly effective for deep learning models, as it allows us to leverage pre-trained models' knowledge rather than starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous sessions, we learned how to build and train neural networks from scratch. However, training large deep learning models requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Massive datasets** (often millions of examples)\n",
    "2. **Extensive computational resources** (often multiple GPUs)\n",
    "3. **Long training times** (days to weeks)\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning addresses these challenges by letting us capitalise on existing models that have already been trained on large datasets.\n",

    "|----------------|--------------------------|\n",
    "| A child learns to recognize basic shapes before identifying letters | A model learns edge detection before specific object recognition |\n",
    "| A musician who knows piano can learn guitar faster than a novice | A model trained on one image dataset can adapt quickly to a similar task |\n",
    "| Language skills transfer across related languages (e.g., Spanish to Italian) | NLP models pre-trained on one language can be fine-tuned for another |\n",
    "| Medical students learn general anatomy before specializing | Medical imaging models trained on general X-rays can be fine-tuned for specific conditions |\n",
    "| Engineers apply fundamental principles across different projects | Engineering models transfer physical principles across different applications |\n",

    "This mirrors how neural networks learn hierarchical features. Early layers learn general patterns that are often applicable across domains, while later layers learn task-specific features.\n",
